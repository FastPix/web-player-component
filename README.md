# Introduction:

This SDK simplifies HLS video playback by offering a wide range of customization options for an enhanced viewing experience. It streamlines streaming setup by utilizing playback IDs that have reached the "ready" status to generate stream URLs. These playback IDs enable seamless integration and video playback within the FastPix-player, making the entire streaming process efficient and user-friendly.

# Key Features:

- ## Playback Control:

  - The `playback-id` allows for easy video playback by linking directly to the media file. Playback is available as soon as the media status is "ready."
  
  - `auto-play`: Automatically starts playback once the video is loaded, providing a seamless user experience.

  - `loop`: Allows the video to repeat automatically after it finishes, perfect for continuous viewing scenarios.

  - **Note** : Some browsers restrict `auto-play` functionality, especially for videos with audio. To comply with these restrictions, `auto-play` often requires explicit user interaction or permission to be enabled. Ensure users are aware and can manually activate `auto-play` if needed.

- ## Security:

  - the `token` attribute is required to play private or DRM protected streams

  - **Note:** The token can be empty for public streams

- ## Inbuilt error handling:

  - The player includes inbuilt error handling that displays appropriate error messages, helping developers quickly understand and address any issues that arise during playback.

- ## Seek and Load Options:

  - **Forward-Seek** and **Backward-Seek** are customizable options that allow users to define specific time intervals for skipping forward or backward, providing a tailored navigation experience.
  - **Thumbnail Seeking** is enabled by default and allows users to preview video frames by hovering or seeking over the timeline, enhancing navigation.
  - **Preloading** options, such as `metadata`, ensure that video data is loaded in advance, reducing buffer times.

- ## Poster customization:

  - Display a preview image at a specified time using the `thumbnail-time` attribute, set a custom `poster` image to show before the video begins playing, or use a `placeholder` to display a temporary image or background while the video is loading.

- ## Auto detection of subtitles and audio tracks:

  - The player automatically detects subtitles from the manifest file and displays them during playback. This ensures that users can easily access available subtitle tracks without additional configuration.

  - Users can switch between available subtitles and audio tracks during playback, offering a personalized viewing experience. This feature allows viewers to choose their preferred language or audio option easily.

- ## Styling and color customization:

  - Customize the playerâ€™s visual elements using the `accent-color`, `primary-color`, and `secondary-color` attributes:

  - `accent-color`: Represents the branding color, ensuring the player aligns with your brand identity.

## Playing public media:

The `playback-id` allows for easy video playback by linking directly to the media file. Playback is available as soon as the media status is "ready".

### For on-demand videos:

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" />
```

Here, the `stream-type` is set to `on-demand` by default.

## For live-stream videos:

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" stream-type="live-stream" />
```

Here, the `stream-type` is set to `live-stream` to play live streams.

## Securing your playback:

Secure your video playback with a signed playback using a `playback-id` and `token`.

- **On-Demand Videos** : Use the playback-id and token to control access to the video. The token ensures only authorized users can play the video.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-playback-id" 
  stream-type="on-demand" 
  token="your-secure-token"
></fastpix-player>
```
- **Live-Stream Videos** : Similarly, for live streams, provide the playback-id and token to secure access.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-live-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  token="your-secure-token">
</fastpix-player>
```

The token ensures authorized access, securing both on-demand and live-stream content.

## Data Integration:
Data integration involves combining data from different sources to provide a unified view.

### Data Integration Overview

In this implementation, various video and user-related attributes are extracted and mapped for analytics tracking. These attributes help monitor and analyze video playback behavior, user interaction, and other metrics.

**Important Note:**

- To enable data integration, ensure the `metadata-workspace-key` attribute is present.

- **Disable data monitoring:**

  To disable data tracking after providing all required attributes, use the `disable-data-monitoring` attribute.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-live-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  metadata-workspace-key="metadata workspace key"  
  metadata-video-title="video title"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="user id"
  metadata-video-id="video-id"
  disable-data-monitoring
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

- **Enabling Debugging for Data Monitoring Setup:** 

To facilitate debugging of the data monitoring setup, use the `enable-debug` attribute.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-live-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  metadata-video-title="video title"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="user id"
  metadata-video-id="video-id"
  enable-debug
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

- **Respecting 'Do Not Track' Preferences:** 

To honor users' privacy preferences regarding the 'Do Not Track' setting, set the `respect-do-not-track` attribute to `true`.


```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-live-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  metadata-video-title="video title"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="user id"
  metadata-video-id="video-id"
  respect-do-not-track
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

 
- **Disabling Cookies During Data Monitoring:** 

  If you prefer to monitor data without utilizing cookies, include the `disable-cookies` attribute.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-live-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  metadata-workspace-key="metadata workspace key"  
  metadata-video-title="video title"
  metadata-viewer-user-id="user id"

### loop:

The `loop` attribute allows the video to restart automatically from the beginning once it ends, creating a seamless playback experience.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  loop
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

### muted:

The `muted` attribute sets the initial volume of the video to 0, ensuring playback starts without sound. This is particularly useful for `auto-play` functionality, as many browsers require videos to be muted to play automatically.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  muted
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

  playback-id="your-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  no-volume-pref
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

### playback-rates:

The `playback-rates` attribute defines a list of available playback speed options for the user to select.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  playback-rates="3 5 2 1"
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

### preload:

The preload attribute in the <fastpix-player> element specifies how the player should preload the media content. It can take the following values:

- `auto`: The player will preload the entire media file to ensure immediate playback without buffering.

- `metadata`: Only the metadata (e.g., duration, dimensions) of the media file will be preloaded, without fetching the entire content.

- `none`: The player will not preload the media and will only load the content when playback is initiated by the user.

```html
<fastpix-player preload="auto" playback-id="your-playback-id" ></fastpix-player>
```

### start-time:

The `start-time` attribute allows specifying the initial playback position in seconds when the video starts.

```html
<fastpix-player 
  playback-id="your-playback-id"
  stream-type="live-stream" 
  start-time=5
  >
</fastpix-player>
```

### title:

The `title` attribute in <fastpix-player> displays the provided text at the top left corner of the player, offering a brief description or title of the video content. This can be useful for displaying the video's name or additional context directly on the player interface.

  Here are the resolution settings for the min-resolution, max-resolution, resolution, and rendition-order attributes:

- `min-resolution`: Specifies the minimum resolution for video playback, preventing lower-quality video selections.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" min-resolution="1440p" />
```
- `max-resolution`: Sets the maximum resolution for video playback, restricting higher-quality video selections.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" max-resolution="1440p" />
```

- `resolution`: Defines the preferred resolution for video playback, with potential adjustments based on conditions.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" resolution="1440p" />
```
`rendition-order`: Specifies the priority order for video resolutions in adaptive streaming, which can be set to either `asc`(ascending) or `desc` (descending), with the default being `asc`.

```html
<fastpix-player
  playback-id="playback-id"
  resolution="1440p"
  rendition-order="desc"
/>
```

## Image Customizations:

Image customization allows you to adjust the appearance of media elements such as thumbnails, posters, and spritesheets in the player.

### poster:

The `poster` attribute specifies an image to display as a preview before the video starts playing.

- You can change or override the default `poster` attribute in the <fastpix-player> element whenever needed by setting a new image URL. For example:

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" poster="https://example.com/new-poster-image.jpg" />
```

- To remove the poster in <fastpix-player>, set the poster attribute to an empty string (poster="").

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" poster=""></fastpix-player>
```

### placeholder:

The `placeholder` attribute in <fastpix-player> is used to specify a fallback image that is displayed before the video starts playing, serving as a preview or loading image.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" placeholder="loading-image.jpg"></fastpix-player>
```
### thumbnail-time:

The `thumbnail-time` attribute in <fastpix-player> allows you to specify a particular time (in seconds) within the video to capture a frame for the thumbnail. This enables setting a custom thumbnail image from a specific moment in the video, rather than using a default thumbnail.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="playback-id" thumbnail-time={8}></fastpix-player>
```

## Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility:
Customize keyboard shortcuts with `hot-keys` for efficient video control and use `disable-keyboard-controls` to disable keyboard interactions for enhanced accessibility or specific use cases.

- `hot-keys`: The `hot-keys` attribute specifies custom keyboard shortcuts (e.g., KeyK, KeyC), but when set, control for these specific keys will be disabled within the <fastpix-player>.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="your-playback-id" hot-keys="KeyK KeyC" ></fastpix-player> 
```
The available keys are - `KeyK`, `KeyC`, `KeyF`, `KeyM`, `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `Space`;

- `disable-keyboard-controls`: The `disable-keyboard-controls` attribute disables all keyboard interactions for video playback within the <fastpix-player>, preventing any keyboard shortcuts from being used.

```html
<fastpix-player playback-id="your-playback-id" hot-keys="KeyK KeyC" ></fastpix-player> 
```

## Adding Chapters to Player and Event Listening:

### Chapters and Event Listeners:

The `chapters` feature lets you divide your video into sections, making navigation easier for users. Each chapter has a startTime, optional endTime, and a title. This is useful for allowing users to jump to specific parts of a video quickly.

Below is a simple example of how to add chapters to the <fastpix-player> and listen for events like `timeupdate` and c`hapterchange`:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const fpPlayerElement = document.querySelector('fastpix-player');

    fpPlayerElement.addEventListener('timeupdate', (event) => {
      const currentTime = fpPlayerElement.currentTime;
      console.log('Current Time:', currentTime);
    });

    const chapters = [
      { startTime: 0, endTime: 2, value: 'chapter-1' },
      {
        startTime: 4,
        value: 'Chapter 2'
      },
      {
        startTime: 5,
        endTime: 6,
        value: 'Chapter 3'
      },
    ];

    function addChaptersToPlayer() {
      if (fpPlayerElement && typeof fpPlayerElement.addChapters === 'function') {
        fpPlayerElement.addChapters(chapters);
      } else {
        console.error('addChapters method not found on fpPlayerElement');
      }
    }

    console.log("Source URL:", fpPlayerElement.currentSrc);
    console.log("readyState:", fpPlayerElement.readyState);
    console.log("buffered:", fpPlayerElement.buffered);

    // Wait until the player has loaded some data to associate chapters
    if (fpPlayerElement && fpPlayerElement.readyState >= 1) {
      addChaptersToPlayer();
    } else {
      if (fpPlayerElement) {
        fpPlayerElement.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', addChaptersToPlayer, { once: true });
      } else {
        console.error('fpPlayerElement not found');
      }
    }

    if (fpPlayerElement) {
      fpPlayerElement.addEventListener('chapterchange', () => {
        console.log('Chapter change event detected');
        console.log("Active Chapter:", fpPlayerElement.activeChapter());
        console.log("Chapters:", fpPlayerElement.chapters);
      });

      fpPlayerElement.addEventListener('error', () => {
        console.log('Error detected');
        console.log("Active Chapter:", fpPlayerElement.activeChapter());
      });
    } else {
      console.error('fpPlayerElement not found');
    }
  });
</script>
```

With `convertOpenAIChapters` Method:

If your chapters are generated by OpenAI, you can use the `convertOpenAIChapters` method to easily format them for the player:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const fpPlayerElement = document.querySelector('fastpix-player');

    // Assuming OpenAI returns chapter data
    const openAIchapters = [
      { startTime: 0, value: 'Chapter 1' },
      { startTime: 4, value: 'Chapter 2' },
      { startTime: 5, value: 'Chapter 3' },
    ];

    // Convert OpenAI chapters to the right format
    const chapters = convertOpenAIChapters(openAIchapters);

    function addChaptersToPlayer() {
      if (fpPlayerElement && typeof fpPlayerElement.addChapters === 'function') {
        fpPlayerElement.addChapters(chapters);
      } else {
        console.error('addChapters method not found');
      }
    }

    if (fpPlayerElement && fpPlayerElement.readyState >= 1) {
      addChaptersToPlayer();
    } else {
      fpPlayerElement.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', addChaptersToPlayer);
    }
  });
</script>
```

- **Key Steps in the Code :**

- **Chapter Definition**: Chapters are defined in an array, with each chapter having a `startTime`, `endTime`, and `value`.
- **Event Listeners**: The code listens for `timeupdate` to monitor playback, and `loadedmetadata` to ensure the player is ready before adding chapters.
- **Adding Chapters**: The chapters are added to the player with the `addChapters method`, which should be supported by the <fastpix-player> element.
- **Handling Events**: The code handles `chapterchange` and error events to track chapter changes and errors during playback.
- **Without convertOpenAIChapters** : You manually format and add the chapters.
- **With convertOpenAIChapters**: You automatically convert OpenAI's chapter data into the proper format for the player.

This simplifies adding chapters to the player, especially when dealing with large sets of data from external sources.
